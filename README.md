# EditHelpBundle

----

This repository is what we call a "subtree split": a read-only copy of one directory of the main repository. 
It is used by Composer to allow developers to depend on specific bundles.

If you want to report or contribute, you should instead open your issue on the main repository: https://github.com/Novactive/Nova-eZPlatform-Bundles

Documentation is available in this repository via `.md` files but also packaged here: https://novactive.github.io/Nova-eZPlatform-Bundles/master/CloudinaryBundle/README.md.html
